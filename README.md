# JSON File Stub API Tool

Silly tool to serve out static files out of /dist and serve out JSON files from /routes by making pretend routes.

E.g.

    ./routes/index.json -> ./routes
    ./routes/other/index.json -> ./other

## Todo

Much refactoring and actual design, command line usability, everything else
